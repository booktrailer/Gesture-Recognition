This is my very first project with gesture recognition!

I coded functions including find the slope of the hand, check if thumbs up, check if thumbs down, check for pointing up, know the direction of the hand, and check if you are flipping the application off...

Enjoy! I have an even bigger project with gesture recognition that I hope to be able to "ship" next season.

Update: Both hands can be viewed at the same time, and also added finger pointing down, peace sign, high five, and more!

Update 2: Allows you to save frames onto your computer in a "save_frames" folder! Press space bar to activate this feature.
