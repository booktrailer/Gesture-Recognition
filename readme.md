This is my very first project with gesture recognition!

I coded functions including find the slope of the hand, check if thumbs up, check if thumbs down, know the direction of the hand, and check if you are flipping the application off...

Enjoy! I have an even bigger project with gesture recognition that I hope to be able to "ship" next season.
